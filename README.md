# Package ltbycatch
#### This package generates marine mammal population projections based on starting abundance, life history, and bycatch rates. These tools are intended to be used in cases where data on bycatch and/or population status are sparse or unavailable.

## Details
This R package contains the functions used in the Marine Mammal Bycatch Impacts Exploration Tool (mmBIET), a Shiny app built by Margaret Siple and André Punt for the Ocean Modeling Forum's [Marine Mammal Bycatch Working Group](https://oceanmodelingforum.org/working-groups/marine-mammal-bycatch-working-group/). The tool is available [here](https://msiple.shinyapps.io/mammaltool/).

Our target audience is stakeholders interested in projecting marine mammal populations to examine the impacts of bycatch. Those code could also be used as a teaching tool, or for anyone who is more familiar with R than FORTRAN and wants to use some components of the BALEEN II model (Punt 1999).
